# ILIMIB  
### The "If you Like It, Make It Better" Code-Available License  

ILIMIB (**If you Like It, Make It Better**) is a **code-available** license designed for solo developers who want contributions without giving up control over their projects.  

## üõ† Why ILIMIB?  

As a solo developer, ensuring code quality can be a challenge‚Äîthere's no oversight, no team reviews, and no structured feedback loop. At the same time, making a project fully open source (GPL, MIT, etc.) isn't always a good fit, especially for unique or one-of-a-kind projects.  

I created ILIMIB as a **middle ground**:  
- **Code-available**, so others can contribute.  
- **Not open source**, meaning the project remains under the original author's control.  
- **No forced distribution**, but the author *can* grant permission for distribution at their discretion.  

This ensures that developers can receive meaningful contributions without worrying about losing control over their work.  

## üîç How ILIMIB Works  

- Contributors **can** fork or clone the project, but all copies remain under ILIMIB licensing.  
- Any **modifications or improvements** made must respect the terms of ILIMIB.  
- The **original author retains ownership** of all forks and clones.  
- The full licensing terms are outlined in the ILIMIB document.  

## üë• Who is ILIMIB For?  

ILIMIB is ideal for:  
‚úÖ **Solo developers** who need external contributions but want to retain control.  
‚úÖ **Projects that scale beyond a single developer‚Äôs capacity.**  
‚úÖ **Free projects** where the main featureset is accessible to everyone.  
   - Microtransactions, donations, and premium features *are* allowed under ILIMIB.  
   - However, the **core functionality cannot be paywalled**.  

## üìú How to Use ILIMIB  

ILIMIB is free to use for any project that meets the following conditions:  
1. The **primary featureset is not paywalled** (subscriptions/microtransactions are allowed).  
2. The **license text remains unchanged** in the project.  
3. The **original author‚Äôs ownership and control are respected**.  

Simply include the **ILIMIB license file** in your repository, and you're good to go!
